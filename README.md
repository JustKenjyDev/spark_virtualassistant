# spark_virtualassistant
A python code, made for RaspBerry Pi to work as an Virtual assistant

This code was ran on a RaspBerry Pi with a PiHat installed connected to a speaker.

The Raspberry Pi was running on a normal PiOS, configured to start the script on boot (brain.py).

# THE SCRIPT DOES NOT RUN WITHOUT INTERNET CONNECTION! 

All files need to be in the same folder as the brain.py script.
